Exercise 2.1 (Prove a Chernoff bound).

(0+10 points)

In several steps you shall prove the

Theorem (Chernoff, positive part). Let X = i<n Xi with independent,
p-biased Bernoulli variables Xi ←− {0, 1} with prob (Xi = 1) = p.
" #
Let ε ∈ 0, 12 . Then for some constant c > 0 we have

prob (X − E X ≥ ε E X) ≤ e−cε E X .

By the linearity of the expected value, we have that

It remains to compute

)
E eαXi = prob (Xi = 1) · eα·1 + prob (Xi = 0) · eα·0
= p · eα + (1 − p) · 1 = 1 + p(eα − 1),
so that overall we obtain

(1 + p(eα − 1)) = (1 + p(eα − 1))n

(iii) Use 1 + x ≤ ex to estimate E eαX by eβnp for some β.
Solution.

If we use x = p(eα − 1) and apply the inequality, we obtain
α

Hence

1 + p(eα − 1) ≤ ep(e −1) .

E(eαX ) = (1 + p(eα − 1))n ≤ (ep(e −1) )n = enp(e −1) ,

so for β = (eα − 1) we obtain the desired result.

(iv) Prove
eα − 1 − α(1 + ε) ≤ − 13 ε2 for a suitable α and for each
#
" that
ε ∈ 0, 12 .
Solution.

We start by noting, that eα − 1 − α(1 + ε) ≤ − 31 ε2 is equivalent to

1
eα − 1 − α(1 + ε) + ε2 ≤ 0.
3
If we consider the left hand side as a function of α, we can compute that the minimum is obtained at α = ln(1 + ε). Because of this we will consider α = ln(1 + ε)
and it remains to show that for any ε in question

1
1
f (ε) = eln(1+ε) − 1 − ln(1 + ε)(1 + ε) + ε2 = ε − ln(1 + ε)(1 + ε) + ε2 ≤ 0.
3
3
We "can compute
that f (0) = 0, so our aim will be to show, that f ′ (ε) ≤ 0 for
#
ε ∈ 0, 12 such that the function f (ε) will decrease (or stay constant) and hence be
0 or negative in the given interval.
Computing f ′ yields

f ′ (ε) = 1 −

1+ε
2
2
− ln(1 + ε) + ε = ε − ln(1 + ε).
1+ε
3
3

Again we have f ′ (0) = 0 and it’s not immediate to see that f ′ (ε) ≤ 0. But if we
compute the second derivative, we have

1
2
,
f ′′ (ε) = −
3 1+ε
"
#
which is negative for ε ∈ 0, 21 . So in this interval, f ′ (ε) will be a decreasing
function, and as it starts at 0, it will be negative. So also f will be a "decreasing
#
function and as it starts at 0 as well, it will be negative throughout ε ∈ 0, 12 .
"
#
So indeed, the given inequality holds for α = ln(1 + ε) and ε ∈ 0, 21 .

(v) Apply Markov’s inequality for Z = eαX to prove the theorem.
Solution.

+2

What we want to prove is that
prob (X − E X ≥ ε E X) ≤ e−cε E X .

t

2

To transform the probability into a form such that we can apply Markov, we calculate
+
*
prob (X − E X ≥ ε E X) = prob (X ≥ (1 + ε) E X) = prob eαX ≥ eα(1+ε) E X ,

b-i

where the last equality holds as α > 0, such that eαx is a monotone increasing
function in x.

But Z = eαX is now a positively distributed random variable, such that we can
apply Markov’s inequality:
*
+
*
+
prob eαX ≥ eα(1+ε) E X = prob Z ≥ eα(1+ε) E X ≤

E(Z)
.
eα(1+ε) E X

But we have already estimated E(Z) and inserting this leads to
α

α
e(e −1) E X
≤
= e((e −1)−(α(1+ε))) E X .
eα(1+ε) E X
eα(1+ε) E X

E(Z)

Now we can use our inequality from the previous part and the fact that et E(X) is a
positive monotone increasing function in t, to conclude that
α

e((e −1)−(α(1+ε))) E X ≤ e− 3 ε E X = e−cε E X ,

for c = 31 .

You may want to consider the negative part, namely that also
2

prob (X − E X ≤ −ε E X) ≤ e−cε E X .

Hint: α < 0 does help.

(v) For which ε does the ε-annulus have at least 99% of the ball volume?
Solution. If we consider the previous picture, the graph in which we have control of both lower and higher dimensions, is the graph of ε = d1 . The idea now is
to consider ε = dc to get a different constant. We compute that the volume of the
annulus compared to the ball itself is

Amit, Bastian, Gerd, Penelope, Jonathan, Annika & Michael
To obtain 1 − e−c ≥ 0.99, we need to solve e−c ≤ 0.01. As the exponential function
is monotone increasing, this is equivalent to
−c ≤ ln(0.01) ⇔ c ≥ ln(100).
So especially for c = ln(100) = 4.605 we have that an ε = dc -annulus contains
more than 99% of the volume of any d-dimensional ball.

Estimate its near surface volume ∆n \ (c + (1 − ε)(∆n − c)) with c =

From the lecture we know that for A ⊂ Rd , ε ∈ [0, 1] with (1 − ε)A ⊂ A
vol((1 − ε)A) = (1 − ε)d vol(A) and
vol(A \ (1 − ε)A) = vol(A) − vol((1 − ε)A).
