Exercise 0.1 (Recall: Random variables).

(8 points)

t

(i) Consider the course’ example: A player has a fair die D resulting in
one of D := { , , , , , } with probability 16 each, ie. D ←− D
uniformly, and a fair coin C ←− {0, 1} uniformly.

b-i

Actually, our player is a cheater and the coin merely tells whether he
decides to cheat or not. In case the coin comes up heads, say that’s
encoded 1, he changes the die’s outcome to . Denote the variable
describing the faked die by F .
(a) Describe F as a function of C and D.
Solution.

We have (if we identify the die’s results with the numbers 1 to 6)

if C = 0
else.

(b) Note that the pair (C, F ) is again a random variable, namely
with outputs in {0, 1} × D. Write down a 2 × 6-table with its
distribution.

2

Solution. We obtain for all combinations of C ∈ {0, 1} and F ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
that the probability of prob ((C, F ) = (c, f )) takes the values of:
(c, f )

Solution. If the variables were independent, it should hold that for all c ∈
{0, 1}, f ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} we would have
prob (C = c ∧ F = f ) = prob (C = c) · prob (F = f ) .
Now we can choose one of the many counterexamples:
prob (C = 1 ∧ F = 1) = 0 ̸=

= prob (C = 1) · prob (F = 1) ,

or just as well

(ii) Consider a continuous random variable U with outcomes in [0, 1] ⊂
R with uniform density, ie. U ←− [0, 1] with density p(x) = 1 for
x ∈ [0, 1] and p(x) = 0 otherwise.
Determine the density of U 2 , ie. a function q such that
"

prob a < U 2 < b =

Solution. A nice way to see this is to consider the function Q(x) = prob U 2 < x .
As it holds that
$

a

q(x) dx = Q(b) − Q(a)

we know that Q must be the anti derivative of q. We compute

Solution. As the distribution is discrete (meaning: there are just finitely many
outputs for M ) we have
prob (M = a) = prob (M ≤ a) − prob (M ≤ (a − 1)) ,

Side remark: to indicate how a real number was rounded we append a special symbol. Examples: π = 3.14 = 3.142 = 3.1416 = 3.14159 . The height of the platform
shows the size of the left-out part and the direction of the antenna indicates whether actual value is larger or smaller than displayed. We write, say, e = 2.72 = 2.71 as if the
shorthand were exact.
